```

## Running the project locally
To run the project locally, you can use the following command:
<Steps>
1. Build the `sicoco-v3` first with the command `npm run build:package`. Call this command every time there is a change so that the test application can do hot reload.
2. Go to the `docs` folder.
3. Add the library / adjustments that have been added.
4. The test project is already equipped with automatic tests, please add automatic tests for the components that have been created as well.
5. Run the command `npm run dev` to run the project locally.
</Steps>

## Pushing the changes to the repository
<Steps>
1. After adding / modifying the component, please create a pull request to the `main` branch.
2. Wait until the automatic test is complete. In order for the branch to be merged into `main`, all test cases that have been created must be `PASSED`.
3. After all testcases passed, wait for other team members to review and accept all changes that have been made.
4. Merge to main.
</Steps>
